    "### Part 4: Human in the Loop \n",
    "LangGraphs ***Persistence*** layer supports human-in-the-loop workflows , allowing execution to pause and resume based on user feedback \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key Use Cases for human-in-the-loop workflows in LLM-based applications include:\n",
    "        - 🛠️ Reviewing tool calls: Humans can review, edit, or approve tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution.\n",
    "        - ✅ Validating LLM outputs: Humans can review, edit, or approve content generated by the LLM.\n",
    "        - 💡 Providing context: Enable the LLM to explicitly request human input for clarification or additional details or to support multi-turn conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Key methods/functions used to faciliate human in the loop \n",
    "- The **[interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/#interrupt)** function facilitates feedback. \n",
    "    - When called inside a node, the graph will pause execution, and once user feedback is provided, Execution can be resumed by using a **[Command](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/human_in_the_loop/#the-command-primitive)** primative, which can be passed through invoke, stream, or async equivalent methods\n",
    "    - *Interupt* does not automatically resume execution from the interruption point. Instead, they rerun the entire node where the interrupt was used. For this reason, interrupts are typically best placed at the start of a node or in a dedicated node.\n",
    "    - Warning: place code with overhead (api calls, chained commands that execute other commands) AFTER the interrupt to avoid duplication, as these are re-trieggered every timne the node is resumed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tool usage Note\n",
    "- The LLM specified is in charge of implicitly deciding what tool to use out of the portfollio of tools specified in the list of tools binded to the llm. if you want weather, you ask for weather, if u want feedback, you specificy you want someone to provide input. There is no explicit routing of tools based on specific critera other than the model 'guessing' what tool is most relevant given the user situation"
